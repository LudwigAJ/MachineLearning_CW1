A Machine Learning model employing Decision Trees in order to be able to correctly predict which room an individual is in based on the Wi-Fi signal strength that person's device receives.

A program that takes in a .txt file containing Wi-Fi strengths from different routers recorded by an agent in a room.
.txt file must contain data formated as the Wi-Fi strength given in each column corresponding to their router, with the room being labeled in the last column.

Run the program by writing:
  python3 /pathToPythonFile
